Black Dusk – A Hearts of Iron IV Total Conversion Mod
 Overview
Black Dusk is a mythic alt-history total conversion mod for Hearts of Iron IV, blending the emotional intensity of TNO, the cinematic brutality of Call of Duty, and the ideological distortion of modern propaganda. Set in a world shattered by the rise of the Black Liberation Army (BLA)—a global supremacist regime masquerading as a liberation movement—the mod explores the collapse of old powers, the rise of rogue factions, and the Second Crusade to reclaim sovereignty.
 
 Global Fronts

Getting Started (Quick Test)
---------------------------
- Enable the `Black_Dusk` mod in the HOI4 launcher.
- Start a new game with a bookmarked start date (2028.1.1 is the designed start).
- Check the launcher logs (Documents/My Games/Paradox Interactive/Hearts of Iron IV/logs/error.log and error.log.old) for parse errors.
- Run the included localisation checker by opening PowerShell and running:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "mod\Black_Dusk\tools\check_localisation.ps1"
```

Known issues:
- Some event/localisation keys were missing; running the localisation checker will help identify if anything else is missing.
- The mod uses overridden `history/states/` files; ensure your province lists are correct for the base map if you change them.
