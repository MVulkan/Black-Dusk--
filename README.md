# BLACK DUSK: THE END OF MANY

## A Hearts of Iron IV Total Conversion Mod

### Overview

Black Dusk is a mythic alt-history total conversion mod for Hearts of Iron IV, blending the emotional intensity of TNO, the cinematic brutality of Call of Duty, and the ideological distortion of modern propaganda.

Set in a world shattered by the rise of the **Black Liberation Army (BLA)**—a global supremacist regime masquerading as a liberation movement—the mod explores the collapse of old powers, the rise of rogue factions, and the **Second Crusade** to reclaim sovereignty.
